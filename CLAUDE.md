# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Project Overview

This is a Flask-based GPG webservice that provides cryptographic operations (signing, verification, encryption, decryption) via HTTP endpoints. The service handles user registration, authentication, and automatic GPG key management with secure storage.

## Architecture

### Core Components
- **Flask Application** (`app.py`): Main entry point with blueprint registration
- **Models** (`models/`): SQLAlchemy database models for users, PGP keys, and challenges
- **Services** (`services/`): Business logic layer for user management, authentication, and challenge handling
- **Routes** (`routes/`): HTTP endpoint handlers organized by functionality (user operations vs GPG operations)
- **Utils** (`utils/`): Cryptographic utilities and GPG operations
- **Database** (`db/`): SQLAlchemy configuration and initialization

### Security Model
- Users authenticate with API keys (SHA256 hashed and used as GPG passphrases)
- Private keys are encrypted with Argon2id + AES-GCM using password-derived keys
- All GPG operations use temporary, isolated keyrings for security
- RSA 3072-bit keypairs are automatically generated on user registration

## Common Development Commands

### Testing
```bash
# Run all tests in Docker (recommended for isolation)
docker-compose run --rm test-runner pytest tests/ -v

# Run specific test files
docker-compose run --rm test-runner pytest tests/test_app.py -v
docker-compose run --rm test-runner pytest tests/test_models.py -v
docker-compose run --rm test-runner pytest tests/test_services.py -v

# Run with coverage
docker-compose run --rm test-runner pytest tests/ --cov=. --cov-report=html

# Run single test
docker-compose run --rm test-runner pytest tests/test_app.py::test_register -v
```

### Local Development
```bash
# Start development server
docker-compose up webservice

# Initialize database locally
python -c "from app import init_db; init_db()"

# Start local Flask server
python app.py
```

### Database Operations
```bash
# Reset database
rm -f gpg_users.db instance/gpg_users.db

# Check database schema
sqlite3 gpg_users.db ".schema"

# Inspect data
sqlite3 gpg_users.db "SELECT username, api_key FROM users;"
```

## Key Implementation Details

### GPG Operations
- All GPG operations must use temporary directories (`tempfile.mkdtemp()`) for isolation
- GPG agent is disabled via environment variables (`GPG_AGENT_INFO=""`, `DISPLAY=""`)
- Private key passphrases are derived from API keys: `hashlib.sha256(api_key.encode()).hexdigest()`
- Public keys are stored as ASCII-armored text in the database
- Private keys are encrypted before database storage using `crypto_utils.encrypt_private_key()`

### Authentication Flow
1. User registration generates API key and RSA keypair
2. Private key is encrypted with password-derived key before storage
3. API key serves dual purpose: authentication token and GPG passphrase base
4. All protected endpoints require `X-API-KEY` header validation

### Database Models
- `User`: username, password_hash, api_key
- `PgpKey`: user_id, key_type ('public'/'private'), key_data (ASCII-armored)
- `Challenge`: user_id, challenge_data, signature, created_at

### Error Handling Patterns
- Use try/except blocks around all GPG operations with proper cleanup
- Return meaningful error messages without exposing sensitive details
- Always clean up temporary directories in finally blocks
- Log errors appropriately but don't expose internal details to API responses

## Testing Considerations

### Test Environment
- Tests run in Docker with complete GPG isolation
- Each test uses fresh database state (SQLite in-memory or temporary files)
- Test fixtures include pre-generated Alice/Bob GPG keys in `tests/fixtures/`
- All tests must clean up temporary files and directories

### Test Patterns
- Use `register_user()` helper function for user setup in integration tests
- Mock external dependencies in unit tests
- Test both success and failure scenarios for all endpoints
- Verify proper cleanup of temporary resources

## Important Security Notes

- Never commit actual GPG keys or API keys to the repository
- All GPG operations must be isolated using temporary directories
- Passwords are hashed with Argon2id before storage
- Private keys are never exposed in API responses
- API keys are validated on every protected endpoint access

## File Upload Handling

- Use `werkzeug.utils.secure_filename()` for all uploaded filenames
- Store uploads in temporary locations and clean up after processing
- Validate file types and sizes before processing
- Handle multipart/form-data correctly for file uploads with additional parameters
